## Team Processes

* Use PEP8 as the coding standard for Python.
* Pull requests for all commits, even typos.
* Don't merge your own pull request. Find a friend to review your code and merge your pull request.
* Pull requests some contain some tests. Ideally they would contain decent test coverage.
* If you make changes to the API, please help update the API documentation. 

When creating a new pull request:

* If the pull request is still a work-in-progress and should not be merged, say so in the description and then **assign the PR to yourself**. When the PR is ready to be merged, **unassign yourself and add a comment**.
* If a new pull request is ready for review, **leave it unassigned**. This is the assumed state of new PRs, but work-in-progress PRs are quite welcome.
* If you decide to review a pull request with the intent of merging it (or deciding what still needs to be done before merge), then **assign the PR to yourself** so that it's clear that someone's grabbed it.
* Anyone is welcome to informally review a PR and comment on it at any time, no matter who is assigned.
